Catastrophe modeling project, presented to Professor Havens (Math department) at UMass Amherst 2022
Catastrophe modeling is an important tool for insurance companies because without
these models, insurers would be more likely to go bankrupt since they would not be able to
accurately estimate amounts of money needed based on the damages from past disasters.
The inability to do this would interrupt and hold off on payments back to buyers of the
insurance firm. Despite its shortcomings and the limitations we faced in the data sets
we were provided with, we were still able to develop a rudimentary catastrophe model
that estimated the amount of damage caused by a tornado by looking at the strength
of the tornado and the path size and basing it off of tornadoes that occurred in the
past. Insurance companies that have access to more specific details and can account for
location and property data are able to more effectively predict these losses caused by
natural disasters. In doing so, these companies are able to minimize the losses faced by
the insurance company and allows them to properly insure their costumers.
